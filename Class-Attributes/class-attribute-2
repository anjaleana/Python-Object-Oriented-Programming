# is_public_company to the value False

# Implement a function (class callable attribute) named get_sector() that returns the value of the sector attribute of 
# OnlineShop class. 
# You only need to implement this function.

# Implement the HouseProject class with class attributes respectively:

# number_of_floors = 3

# area = 100

# Then, in the HouseProject class implement a function (class callable attribute) called describe_project(),
# which displays basic information about the project as follows:

class HouseProject:
    number_of_floors = 3
    area = 100
    def describe_project():
        print(f'Floor : {HouseProject.number_of_floors}\n'
             f'area: {HouseProject.area}')
    
HouseProject.describe_project()

Floor : 3
area: 100
