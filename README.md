Python is an object-oriented programming language that fully supports OOP principles. Here's a description of Object-Oriented Programming in Python:

Class: 
A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have. In Python, classes are defined using the class keyword.

Object:
An object is an instance of a class. It is a self-contained unit that encapsulates both data (attributes) and behaviors (methods). Objects can be created from a class, and multiple objects can exist for the same class.

Encapsulation:

Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit (the class). In Python, attributes are usually defined within the class's methods
using the self keyword.

Abstraction:
It allows you to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it. Abstract classes and methods can be defined using the @abstractmethod decorator from the abc module.

Inheritance:
Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (the derived or child class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (the base or parent class). In Python, you can create a subclass by specifying the parent class in parentheses when defining the class.

Polymorphism:
Polymorphism is the ability of different objects to respond to the same method in their own unique way. In Python, polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and duck typing, where the behavior of a method depends on the actual object that it is called on.

Constructor and Destructor:
Python classes can have special methods called __init__ (constructor) and __del__ (destructor). The constructor is used to initialize object attributes, while the destructor is used to perform cleanup operations when an object is destroyed.

Access Control:
Python provides access control mechanisms to restrict access to attributes and methods. Attributes and methods can be public, private, or protected using naming conventions (e.g., _private_var) and access modifiers (e.g., @property and @<attribute>.setter).

Composition:
Composition is the practice of building complex objects by combining simpler objects. In Python, you can achieve composition by including instances of other classes as attributes within a class.

Class and Static Methods:
In addition to instance methods, Python supports class methods and static methods. Class methods are bound to the class and can be called on the class itself, while static methods are independent of the class and don't have access to instance-specific data.
